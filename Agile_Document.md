# AI-Powered Research Paper Summarizer & Insight Extractor

---

## 1. Project Title

**AI-Powered Research Paper Summarizer & Insight Extractor**

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Researchers, students, and professionals often struggle to efficiently read, analyze, and extract insights from lengthy academic and industry research papers. Manually going through multiple PDFs is time-consuming, error-prone, and limits productivity. There is a growing need for an intelligent system that can automatically process research documents, extract meaningful information, and present it in an easy-to-understand and searchable format.

This project aims to develop a **GenAI-powered research intelligence platform** that ingests large volumes of research papers, extracts key insights, generates domain-specific summaries, and enables semantic search and structured exploration of knowledge.
